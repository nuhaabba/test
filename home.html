                <p>  Our infant area provides the highest quality care in an environment that is designed with the parent and child in mind. While in our care, the children are stimulated through music, exercise, outdoor blanket time, facial and verbal mimicking as well as lots of hugs and tickles. <br>
                
                    At the toddler age, children are meeting new challenges as fast as they come. Crawling, walking and eventually running are levels they accomplish in what seems like a blink of an eye. Children learn best if they are in a stimulating environment. Music, stories, outdoor play, and learning simplicities envelop much of the day. Our caregivers are dedicated in helping each child develop these skills through a trusting and loving relationship. A parental daily report is given to update each family on meal times, nap times, toilet training and all activities accomplished each day.

                   <p> A good preschool can make a difference in a child's future school years. We offer individual programs for children to help them learn in an environment that is stress free and fun. Some learning centers our preschoolers explore are music, science, math, language arts and manipulative play.</p>

        <p>Our daughter has attended Little Star Daycare since she was 8 months old.  My wife and I have had nothing but a wonderful experience and our daughter loves attending daycare here.  When we began our search, it was very clear that there are some not so great providers out there.  Right from the initial interview, we were treated as family, and our daughter immediately opened up to the provider</p>
